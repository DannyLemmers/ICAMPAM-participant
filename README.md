# Welcome!
In this repository you will find the code and the dataset for the workshop on extracting quality metrics at ICAMPAM. After the workshop has completed, we will upload our version with the complete code. Until then, time to fill in the blanks yourself! 

# Google Colab
Since not everyone will have a jupyter editor installed, we will use Google Colab. You can open this repository in Google Colabs through [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DannyLemmers/ICAMPAM-participant/blob/main/main_participant.ipynb) or the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/github/DannyLemmers/ICAMPAM-participant/blob/main/main_participant.ipynb

# Accessing the data
The easiest way to access the data through Google Colab is to first [download](https://github.com/DannyLemmers/ICAMPAM-participant/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository. Press the green Code button and download the zip. Unpack the zip and upload the folder to your Google Drive. Make sure the folder is named "ICAMPAM-participant" and the DATA folder is in the first layer of the folder ("ICAMPAM-participant/DATA" exists).

# Contact
For any questions about the data or the code. Feel free to contact the authors Sahel Akbari (s.akbari@erasmusmc.nl) or Danny Lemmers (d.lemmers@erasmusmc.nl).
